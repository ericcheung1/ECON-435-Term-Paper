# Econometrics Analysis: Effects of Transit Spending on Unemployment

This repository contains the code to my econometrics term paper which I wrote for ECON 435: Econometrics Methods at Simon Fraser University, where I analyzed how transit infrastructure spending affects unemployment rate in the United States.

# Methods/Techniques

The project uses:

-   Static time series regression

-   Augmented Dickey-Fuller tests for stationarity

-   Breusch-Pagan tests for heteroskedasticity

-   Tidyverse packages for data manipulation and visualization

# Reproducibility 

All results in the paper come from saved RDS objects and PNG figures generated by the scripts in `scripts/`. To reproduce, run R script files in order to clean data, transform data, fit models, perform statistical tests, and generate graphs.
