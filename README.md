# Econometrics Analysis: Effects of Transit Spending on Unemployment

This repository contains my econometric project for ECON 435: Econometrics Methods at Simon Fraser University, where I analyze how transit infrastructure spending affects the unemployment rate in the United States. The project uses static time series regression to evaluate whether changes in public transit investment are associated with labor market outcomes.

# Methods/Techniques

The project uses:

-   Static time series regression

-   Augmented Dickey--Fuller tests for stationarity

-   Breusch--Pagan tests for heteroskedasticity

-   tidyverse packages for data manipulation and visualization

# Reproducibility 

All results in the paper come from saved RDS objects and PNG figures generated by the scripts in `scripts/`. To reproduce, run R script files in order to clean data, transform data, fit models, perform statistical tests, and generate graphs.
